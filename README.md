Debit9 (D9T) Token: Description and Use

The Debit9 (D9T) Token is an ERC-20 token implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, designed with a unique debt management and burning mechanism to incentivize holding and stability. The smart contract includes functionalities for liquidity control, whitelisting, and a debt system that can be forgiven or burned.

Contract Address (BSC): 0xbc305b36d7a6cae9cf8597e8507528bd4a3563f5

Summary of Debit9 Token Usage

The D9T Token serves as the primary currency within the Debit9 ecosystem. Below are its main uses and characteristics:

    Name and Symbol: Debit9 (D9T) 

Decimals: 6 

Max Supply (MAX_SUPPLY): 10,000,000,000,000 D9T 

Owner: The owner (contract deployer) has control over administrative functions such as pausing the contract, setting liquidity pools, managing token burning, and adding/removing addresses from the blacklist.

Token Burning (Burn): The contract has a burning mechanism. Tokens can be burned by the user themselves, or by the owner on behalf of a user. Burning is also integrated into the debt mechanism for users who are not debt-exempt.

Pause/Unpause: The owner can pause and unpause the contract, which restricts most token operations while paused.

Liquidity Pools: Addresses can be designated as "liquidity pools" by the owner. Transactions involving liquidity pools activate certain contract logic, such as debt addition and hold time.

Debt System:

    Debt Accumulation: When selling D9T to a liquidity pool, users can accumulate debt. The debt increases by 50% of the transaction value, limited to a maximum of 100,000 D9T per user.

Debt Forgiveness: Debt can be forgiven over time (30 days for full forgiveness) or through a quitDivida function.

Debt Burning: When a user with debt (and who is not debt-exempt) performs a transfer, a portion of the transferred amount (up to 50% of the transaction or the total debt, whichever is smaller) can be burned to settle the debt.

Hold Time: When buying D9T from a liquidity pool, a dynamic hold time is applied to the buyer, requiring them to hold the tokens for a period before selling them. The hold time ranges from 60 to 600 seconds, depending on the transaction value.

Trusted Contracts: Contracts can be marked as trusted by the owner to exempt them from certain security checks.

Blacklist: The owner can add or remove addresses from the blacklist, preventing listed addresses from performing transactions.

Debt Exemption: The owner can exempt certain addresses from the debt burning mechanism. There is a list of exempt addresses that can be queried.

Single Transaction Per Block: Each address is limited to one transaction per block to prevent certain manipulations.

Benefits for Users and Why to Trust and Buy D9T

The Debit9 (D9T) Token was designed with a focus on sustainability and incentivizing long-term holding, which translates into several benefits for users:

    Debt Burning Mechanism for Stability: The debt and burning system helps manage token supply. By burning tokens from indebted users in certain transactions, the contract aims to reduce selling pressure and potentially increase token scarcity, benefiting long-term holders.

Holding Incentive (Hold Time): The hold time imposed after purchases from liquidity pools encourages users to hold their tokens for a period. This can reduce short-term volatility and promote a more stable holder ecosystem.

Transparency and Control: The contract is public and the source code is available, allowing the community to audit and understand its operation. Owner actions, such as setting liquidity pools and activating burning, are emitted as events, providing transparency.

Active Management: The owner's ability to adjust parameters such as burn activation and liquidity pool management allows for active governance to adapt to market conditions and protect the ecosystem.

    Potential for Appreciation: With scarcity mechanisms (burning) and holding incentives, D9T has the potential for long-term appreciation, attracting investors seeking stability and growth.

Why trust and buy D9T?
Trust in D9T is built on a combination of:

    Defensive Mechanisms: The blacklist system, the one-transaction-per-block restriction, and the ability to pause the contract provide layers of security against abuse and coordinated attacks.

Focus on Sustainability: The debt, burning, and hold time features are designed to create a more sustainable environment less prone to rapid pumps and dumps.

    Transparent Development: The project is committed to transparency, providing access to the code and clear documentation.

1. About Debit9 (D9T) Token

The Debit9 (D9T) Token is an ERC-20 token implemented on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), designed with a unique debt management and burning mechanism to incentivize holding and stability within its ecosystem.

2. Contract Details

    Token Name: Debit9 

Token Symbol: D9T 

Decimals: 6 

Max Supply: 10,000,000,000,000 D9T 

    Contract Address (BSC): 0xbc305b36d7a6cae9cf8597e8507528bd4a3563f5

3. Key Features

The D9T Token incorporates several features aimed at promoting sustainability and controlled supply:

    Token Burning: D9T tokens can be burned by users or by the contract owner. A significant aspect of the token's mechanics involves burning tokens from users with accumulated debt during certain transfer operations.

Debt System:

    Debt Accumulation: When users sell D9T to a designated liquidity pool, they may accumulate debt. This debt is initially 50% of the transaction amount, capped at a maximum of 100,000 D9T per user.

Debt Forgiveness: Accumulated debt can be forgiven over time (fully forgiven after 30 days) or through a specific function call by the user.

Debt Burning: If a user with debt (and not exempt from debt) makes a transfer, a portion of the transferred amount (up to 50% of the transaction or the total debt, whichever is smaller) can be burned to settle their outstanding debt.

Hold Time Mechanism: When D9T is purchased from a liquidity pool, a dynamic hold time is applied to the buyer. This requires the buyer to hold their tokens for a period (ranging from 60 to 600 seconds) before being able to sell them back to a liquidity pool.

Liquidity Pool Management: The contract owner can designate specific addresses as "liquidity pools". Transactions involving these pools trigger the debt accumulation and hold time mechanisms.

Administrative Controls (Owner-only): The contract owner has the ability to:

    Pause and unpause the contract, restricting most token operations.

Blacklist and unblacklist addresses, preventing them from interacting with the token.

Set trusted contracts to bypass certain security checks.

Exempt specific addresses from the debt burning mechanism.

Manage the 

burnActive status.

Single Transaction Per Block: To prevent certain arbitrage or manipulation, each address is limited to one transaction per block.
